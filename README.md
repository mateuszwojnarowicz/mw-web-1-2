## Mateusz Wojnarowicz - Web Development Project #2
After doing a course on HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript I decided to put my newly gained knowledge into practice and build a project - JuiceUP - a website for a fictional company specializing in selling fresh juices.

Through this project I want to demonstrate knowledge of:

 - HTML5
 - CSS3
 - basic JavaScript

Plus

 - Web Design + Responsive Web Design
 - CSS Animations
